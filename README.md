 > You will be forming a group of **TWO - THREE** students and work on an interesting project that you will propose yourself (in this `README.md` document). You can pick any project that you'd like, but it needs ot implement three design patterns. Each of the members in a group is expected to work on at least one design pattern and its test cases. You can, of course, help each other, but it needs to be clear who will be responsible for which pattern and for which general project features.
 
 > ## Expectations
 > * Incorporate **three** distinct design patterns, *two* of the design patterns need to be taught in this course:
 >   * Composite, Strategy, Abstract Factory, Visitor, Iterator
 > * All three design patterns need to be linked together (it can't be three distinct projects)
 > * You can pick any of the following languages:
 >   * C/C++, Java, Python
 > * You can incorporate additional technologies/tools but they must be approved (in writing) by the instructor or the TA
 > * Each member of the group **must** be committing code regularly and make sure their code is correctly attributed to them. We will be checking attributions to determine if there was equal contribution to the project.

## Project Description

 > Your project description should summarize the project you are proposing. Be sure to include
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you?
 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
 >   * [toolname](link) - Short description
 > * What will be the input/output of your project?
 > * This description should be in enough detail that the TA/instructor can determine the complexity of the project and if it is sufficient for the team members to complete in the time allotted. 
Input and output:
The input of our application would be the user's information such as first and last name, the value of money that they want to deposit, withdraw, or transfer, and the value of money they want to keep in the saving account in order to invest on Nasdaq Composite stock market with the price at that time. (The type and numbers of stock market could expand)
The output of our application would be the balance of an account, account history, profit for a customized period of time, a budget planning based on checking account's balance. 


This Financial Management Application is intended to help users keep track of their money, be it in a checking or savings account. Upon logging in, existing users have the option to view their balnace, deposit or withdraw funds, and create a projected savings goal. New users will also have access to these options after creating a new account. 

This project will be written in C++.
Tools:
* Tool to fetch the most current stock market prices

Raison D'etre:
Finance management is an essential part of life for everyone. This app helps users to practice and plan their financial life by providing money management features that are consistent with their account balance.  Moreover, it helps users to see their stock profit at a specific period of time (customizable by themselves).


 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "Class Diagram" section below, you will need to 
 > * Set up your GitHub project board as a Kanban board for the project. It should have columns that map roughly to 
 >   * TODO, In progress, In testing, Done
 >   * You can change these or add more if you'd like, but we should be able to identify at least these.
 > * There is no requirement for automation in the project board but feel free to explore those options.
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature and each design pattern and assign them to the appropriate team member.
 > * Break down the first "Epic" into smaller user stories (issues) and assign them to the appropriate team member.
## Class Diagram
 > Include a class diagram and a description of the diagram. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it.
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule two check-in's with the TA (during lab hours or office hours) where your entire group will meet with them and discuss:
 > * What you have each done up to this point
 > * What you plan to do until the next meeting (or until the final demo)
 > * If there is anything that is getting in your way
 
 > You may notice that this is effectively a "standup" meeting. We suggest that as a team you have a daily (or every other day) standup, but this will be a bit more formal with the TA. 
 
 > **Your meetings cannot be in the same week of the session so plan ahead**

 > ## Final deliverable
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
